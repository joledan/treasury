# Purpose

This document compares data sets from the Deforestation Dividends report (2021)
and the Forests and Finance. In particular, we want to understand:

* How the values compare between the two data sets
* Coverage of financial institutions (FIs) between the two data sets
* Types of finance covered in both data sets

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
